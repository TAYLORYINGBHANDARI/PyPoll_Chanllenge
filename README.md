An employee from Colorado Board of Elections has given the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
In this project, our final Python script should be able to deliver the following information when the script is run:

- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received

## Election Audit Summary

Our script effectively found out the votes and voting rate for each county and candiates. Moreover, it is able to find the largest county turn out, and the winner of the election. 
For future purpose, if we need further utilization of this scripts for election commision, we can calculate the amount of votes each candidate received from each county.  A second way of utilizing this script is by changing the county name, where we can calculate votes for city, state, region, or any type of election.
